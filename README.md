## Model Overviews

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and K-medoid clustering is used to identify and predict navigational sequences i.e. trajectories derived from clickstream data.  The model seeks to learn how successful and unsuccessful students progress through course design. For this project, success and non-success is defined by the student receiving a certificate for the course, or not.  Clickstream data generated by students is used to learn about the degree to which learner transition activity aligns with the instructor/course design, as well as the models empirically observe emergent learner behavior patterns.
